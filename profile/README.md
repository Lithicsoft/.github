## Hello üëã

Welcome to Lithicsoft! We are a small non-profit organization dedicated to building accessible and user-friendly software solutions. Founded in 2018 as the EnderOS project ‚Äì the predecessor to the now-defunct UnetOSX ‚Äì we have spent the past few years learning, growing, and advancing technology for the community.

Our mission is simple: to make software, research projects available to as many people as possible, and most importantly, practical. While it may not be perfect at first, we will strive to improve it day by day and with your feedback.

Over time, we have explored new ideas, including the **Lithicsoft Research AI** collection. Although Model 01 is outdated compared to today's advanced technologies such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, it laid the foundation for our journey. Model 02, which we have completed and released to the public, has received some positive attention despite its modest reach.

We have now acquired two exciting projects:

- **Neutron**: A quick custom search engine implementation, designed to complement, not replace, established platforms like Google or Bing.

- **Trainer Studio**: A user-friendly ‚ÄúLocal AutoML‚Äù tool that allows you to train your own machine learning models, no coding required.

The above projects will probably not continue in the future as we focus on new principles, but this new principle will help us create more practical projects and serve the community more.

Although we are small, we are working hard to grow the community and improve our products. We have also partnered with organizations like **ringwormGO** as we continue to expand and share our work with more people.

At Lithicsoft, we prioritize user experience and accessibility, always striving to meet the needs of our users.
