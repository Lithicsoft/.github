## Hi there üëã  

Welcome to Lithicsoft! We‚Äôre a small, non-profit organization dedicated to building software solutions that are accessible and user-friendly. Founded in 2018 with the EnderOS project ‚Äì the predecessor to the now-discontinued UnetOSX ‚Äì we‚Äôve spent the past few years learning, growing, and developing technology for the community.  

Our mission is simple: to create software that is easy to use and available to as many people as possible. While some features may come with small fees, we‚Äôre committed to keeping things affordable and transparent for everyone.  

Over time, we‚Äôve explored new ideas, including the **Lithicsoft Research AI** collection. Although Model 01 has become outdated compared to today‚Äôs advanced technologies like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, it laid the groundwork for our journey. Model 02, which we completed and made public, has received some positive attention despite its modest reach.  

Currently, we‚Äôre focusing on two exciting projects:  
- **Neutron**: A tool for implementing custom search engines quickly, designed to complement rather than replace established platforms like Google or Bing.  
- **Trainer Studio**: A user-friendly ‚ÄúLocal AutoML‚Äù tool that lets you train your own machine learning models, no coding required.  

Though we are small, we work hard to grow our community and improve our products. We‚Äôve also partnered with organizations like **ringwormGO** as we continue to expand and share our work with more people.  

At Lithicsoft, we prioritize user experience and accessibility, always striving to meet the needs of our users.  

Thank you for taking an interest in Lithicsoft. If you have any questions or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out at **lithicsoft@gmail.com** or join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/dNQunYaXrX). We‚Äôd love to hear from you!
