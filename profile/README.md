## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Lithicsoft is a non-profit organization dedicated to developing innovative software solutions. Since its founding in 2018 with the EnderOS project, a precursor to the now-discontinued UnetOSX, Lithicsoft has been committed to creating accessible and user-friendly technology.

Our mission is to provide software that is easy to use and accessible to a wide audience. While some features may have associated fees, we strive to maintain affordability and transparency in our offerings.

One of our notable projects is the Lithicsoft Research AI collection, which includes various models in the research and development phase. Model 01, although outdated compared to newer technologies like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, has served as a foundational tool. Model 02, now completed and made public, has garnered some community attention despite its limited usage.

Lithicsoft is actively working on two innovative projects: the Neutron search engine and Trainer Studio. Neutron is designed to provide a faster solution for implementing custom search engines, rather than replacing established ones like Google or Bing. Trainer Studio empowers users to create AI solutions and train their own models without any coding knowledge.

Despite our modest size, we are working diligently to build our community and enhance our products. We have affiliated with organizations like ringwormGO, striving to expand our reach and recognition.

At Lithicsoft, we prioritize user experience and accessibility in our software development, continually innovating to meet the evolving needs of our users.

Thank you for your interest in the Lithicsoft Organization. Should you have any inquiries, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at lithicsoft@gmail.com or [Lithicsoft's Discord](https://discord.gg/dNQunYaXrX). We look forward to hearing from you.
