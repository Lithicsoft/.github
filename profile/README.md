Lithicsoft Inc is a software company that develops products based on the Free-Safe-Lite criteria, which means they are free to use, safe from malware and light on resources. Some of their outstanding projects include: UnetOSX, a Unix-like operating system for desktops and servers; Los, a lightweight and secure web browser; and LithicAI Education Model, an artificial intelligence system for personalized learning. Lithicsoft was founded in 2018 by Anthony Erosion, who started with the EnderOS project, a predecessor of Unet. Since then, Lithicsoft has launched many new projects and maintained its commitment to the Free-Safe-Lite criterion.
